TODO:

Home page
- Use Angular's $animate service instead of jQuery animations
- Proper routing

Admin panel
- Move $scope.pages and $scope.videos to a service
- Pages section
-- Display states better when making requests to the server
--- Edited/unedited field
--- Request is in the process
- Video section
-- Basic editing of title, page, url; removing and adding new videos
-- Select of page
-- Video upload
- Settings section
-- Password change
-- Language selection

Make json generated on server to be separated by page (faster rendering of a lot of videos)
- Duplicate everything for "All" page?
- Should also be done for better routing on home page. Currently it loops through all pages

Do some styling
Check for uniqueness of slugs in pages
Write some tests
