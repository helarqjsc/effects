TODO:

Home page
- Use ui.router to switch between pages

Admin panel
- Pages section
-- Display states better when making requests to the server
--- Edited/unedited field
--- Request is in the process
- Video section
-- Basic editing of title, page, url; removing and adding new videos
-- Video upload
- Settings section
-- Password change
-- Language selection

Make json generated on server to be separated by page (faster rendering of a lot of videos)
- Duplicate everything for "All" page?

Do some styling
